# ODASA: *Deprecated* in favor of [CodeQL CLI](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli)

This repository contains [binary releases](https://github.com/Semmle/odasa-binaries/releases) of the ODASA command-line tool for interacting with CodeQL. In November 2019, the much-improved [CodeQL CLI](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries) was released. You are encouraged to use that instead.

**Note: the use of ODASA requires a separate license agreement with GitHub; it will not function without a license file**. If you are looking to create and query CodeQL databases for open source code, please use the [CodeQL CLI](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries).
